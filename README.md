# Frontend Mentor - Room homepage solution

This is a solution to the [Room homepage challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/room-homepage-BtdBY_ENq).

## The challenge

The purpose of the challenge was to copy the layout & interactivity presented on challenge pictures starting from simple text file. From this point I had to create proper HTML structure, add layout with CSS and interactivity using JS.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate the slider using their mouse/trackpad
